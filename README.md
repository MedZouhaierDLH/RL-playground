# RL-Playground: Reinforcement Learning from the Ground Up 🎮

## About this Repo
**RL-Playground** is my personal sandbox for learning and experimenting with **Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)**.  
Here, I implement RL algorithms from scratch using **PyTorch**, reproduce ideas from important papers, and deepen my understanding of both theory and practice.  

While the foundation comes from **Berkeley’s CS285: Deep Reinforcement Learning**, this repo is designed to go **far beyond the course**, giving me room to explore advanced RL techniques, new environments, and research-inspired projects.
